- Explain RUN vs CMD vs Entrypoint

RUN: Build time command, if you want to run any command
during the build of the image

Entrypoint & CMD are runtime commands that are used to specify
which command needs to run while running the container

ENTRYPOINT: The executable to run while running the container


CMD: If Entrypoint is not deﬁned, CMD becomes the 1st command
but if deﬁned, CMD is passed as an argument to Entrypoint
